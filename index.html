      <h2>Why Bootcamp at 54?</h2>
      <p>I first became interested in coding over 10 years ago while recovering from a car accident.</p>
      <figure><img id="accident" src="accident_image.jpg" alt="My car after the accident">
        <figcaption>What was left of my car</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>It was a long recovery during which I taught myself the basics of HTML & CSS and dabbled in PHP. I actually contemplated trying to make it as a web developer but I had lost the use of my right hand as a result of the accident and lacked the self confidence to make a go of it. I went back to my job as a tax consultant but still kept one eye on the tech world.</p>
      <p>Another accident in 2016 (this time a bike crash in a middle distance triathlon that broke 5 bones) led to a bit more time off work. This time I discovered Python and taught myself the basics from books and online tutorials but, again, did nothing with it seriously.</p>
      <p>Then came 2020, Covid and lockdown v1.0. My main interest outside work was triathlon and that scene ground to a halt, I lost motivation to train so I had time on my hands. And when I have time on my hands ... yep, Python marched back in to fill the void. One thing led to another and my mind went back 10+ years to my previous flirtation with web development. I started wondering if I could do anything with it seriously because I had been growing increasingly disillusioned with my current career.</p>
      <p>On Twitter I bumped into a Manchester Codes student, discovered their Software Engineer FastTrack Bootcamp and the rest, as they say, is history!</p>
      <p>So you could say my decision to attend Bootcamp was prompted by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a near-fatal car accident;</li>
        <li>a bike crash; and,</li>
        <li>a global pandemic.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Every cloud...</p>
      <p>Some might say that 54 is too old to contemplate such a drastic career shift. I disagree: <strong>you're never too old to learn new things, especially things you have developed a passion for.</strong></p>

      <p>Luckily for me, Kirstie, who was in the car with me in the 2007 accident, agreed to marry me in 2011 and we had a son in 2012. He's called James and he's now an amazingly caring, generous, smart 8 year old with a wicked sense of humour. Kirstie is the love of my life, a <a href="http://www.kirstieedwards.co.uk">professional photographer</a> and senior manager with <a href="https://tropicskincare.com/">Tropic skincare</a>.</p>
      <p>I also have two grown-up daughters, Gemma & Sophie, from a previous relationship and two grandchildren, Benji and Zia. My son James was an uncle when he was born.</p>

      <h2>Hobbies & interests</h2>
      <p>Until the world shut down earlier this year (and I developed a coding obsession) I was a compulsive triathlete training around 10-12 hours a week on average (OCD? What do you mean?). I first discovered triathlon in 2000 and was immediately hooked. In 2005 I had a go at my first Ironman in Nice on the south coast of France. Again I was hooked.</p>
      <p>Ironman is an ultra-distance triathlon covering <strong>140.6 miles</strong> in total made up of:</p>
      <table cellpadding="7">
        <tr><td>Open water swim:</td><td><strong>2.4 miles</strong></td></tr>
        <tr><td>Bike:</td><td><strong>112 miles</strong></td></tr>
        <tr><td>Run:</td><td><strong>26.2 miles</strong></td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>After Nice in 2005 I competed at Ironman UK in Dorset in 2006 (recording my best ever time of 10:56 and coming 15th in my age group) and Lanzarote in 2007.</p>
      <p>4 months after the Lanzarote race my life was turned upside down by a truck.</p>
      <p>After recovering from the accident, getting back my triathlon mojo and getting my bikes converted for one-handed use I took on the inaugural Ironman Wales on 11th September 2011 - 4 years to the day since the accident. My time wasn't exactly electric but crossing that finish line was an emotional moment!</p>
      <p>I completed 4 other Ironman races over the next few years.</p>

        <summary>Details here</summary>
        <table cellpadding="4">
          <tr><td>2014</td><td>Ironman UK - Bolton</td></tr>
          <tr><td>2015</td><td>Ironman UK - Bolton</td></tr>
          <tr><td>2018</td><td>Ironman Denmark - Copenhagen</td></tr>
          <tr><td>2019</td><td>Challenge Roth - Bavaria, Germany</td></tr>
        </table>
      </details>
      <p>I had an entry for the 10<sup>th</sup> edition of Ironman Wales in September this year but it didn't go ahead because of the Covid pandemic. My entry has rolled over to 2021 but, to be honest, I think I might have too much on my plate to train properly for it!</p>

        <h3>Other triathlon-related stuff</h3>
        <p>I'm also a Certified Ironman Coach, British Triathlon Level 1 Coach and during 2018 I set up Thrive Multisport, a triathlon coaching business. Covid has effectively wiped that out for now. I also founded South Cheshire Triathletes, a small club based in, funnily enough, South Cheshire. Covid hasn't quite killed that off ... yet!</p>

      <p>So that's me. I'm sorry my story is so long. I didn't have time to write a shorter one!</p>
