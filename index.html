      <p>I'm Matt, student in the November 2020 cohort of Manchester Codes' Software Engineer FastTrack course</p>
      <p>Compared to everybody else in my cohort I'm an old bloke. At least, that's how it looks from an arithmetic perspective:</p>
      <p><code>my age > (2 x Holly's age)</code></p>
      <p>It's not all about arithmetic and elapsed time though is it? Age is mostly a mindset. I may be closing in fast on my 20,000<sup>th</sup> day but there's still life in this old <s>dog</s> <b>Git</b> yet.</p>

      <h2>What brought me to Manchester Codes?</h2>
      <p>By day I am a Chartered Tax Adviser and have been for more years than I care to remember. The firms I have worked for range from the biggest (KPMG) to the smallest single-partner firms. Over the past few years I have become more and more disillusioned with the job. Maybe I have changed, maybe the job has changed; I don't know. But I no longer feel like my career has any worth. Perhaps helping already-wealthy people to pay less tax is not what the world needs right now.</p>
      <p>There was something of a hiatus in my tax career. On September 11<sup>th</sup> 2007 a truck ran into the back of my car at 56mph when I was sat in a queue on the M6. My girlfriend Kirstie (now my wife) and I nearly didn't make it. Kirstie broke her back (and several other things), I nearly lost my right arm. Surgeons managed to save it but nerve damage was such that my right hand doesn't function.</p>
      <figure><img src="accident_image.jpg" alt="My car after the accident" width="400"><figcaption>My car after the accident</figcaption></figure>
      <p>I didn't work for a long time after the accident. During my recovery (physical and mental!) I got interested in website development, taught myself a bit of HTML & CSS and dabbled in PHP. I actually contemplated not going back to my tax job and trying to make it as a web developer but, for reasons I won't bore you with, I never got anywhere with it and went back into tax. I still kept one eye on the tech world though.</p>
      <p>Another accident in 2016 (this time a bike crash in a middle distance triathlon that broke 5 bones, including pelvis) led to a bit more time off work. This time I discovered Python and taught myself the basics from books and online tutorials but, again, did nothing with it seriously.</p>
      <p>Then came 2020, Covid and lockdown v1.0. The triathlon world ground to a halt and I lost motivation to train so I had time on my hands. And when I have time on my hands ... yep, Python marched back in to fill the void. One thing led to another and I enrolled in Harvard University's online course called <em>CS50 - An Introduction to Computer Science</em>. I absolutely loved that so went on to do a follow-up called <em>CS50W</em> which focussed on web programming with Python & JavaScript.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, my mind went back 10+ years to my previous flirtation with web development and I started wondering if I could do anything with it seriously. On Twitter I bumped into Billy Morrison of this parish and discovered Manchester Codes and the rest, as they say, is history!</p>
      <p>So, to summarise, my decision to enrol with Manchester Codes was prompted by:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li>a near-fatal car accident;</li>
        <li>a bike crash; and,</li>
        <li>a global pandemic.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Every cloud...</p>

      <h2>My family</h2>
      <!-- Insert family pic -->
      <p>Luckily for me, Kirstie, who was in the car with me in the 2007 accident, agreed to marry me in 2011 and we had a son in 2012. He's called James and he's now an amazingly caring, generous, smart 8 year old with a wicked sense of humour. Kirstie is a <a href="http://www.kirstieedwards.co.uk">professional photographer</a> and senior manager with <a href="https://tropicskincare.com/">Tropic skincare</a>.</p>
      <p>I also have two grown-up daughters, Gemma & Sophie, from a previous relationship and two grandchildren. My son James was an uncle when he was born.</p>

      <h2>Hobbies & interests</h2>
      <p>Until the world shut down earlier this year (and I developed a coding obsession) I was a compulsive triathlete training around 10-12 hours a week on average. I first discovered triathlon in 2000 and was immediately hooked. In 2005 I had a go at my first Ironman in Nice on the south coast of France. Again I was hooked.</p>
      <p>Ironman is an ultra-distance triathlon covering <strong>140.6 miles</strong> in total, made up of:</p>
      <table cellpadding="7">
        <tr><td>Open water swim:</td><td><strong>2.4 miles</strong></td></tr>
        <tr><td>Bike:</td><td><strong>112 miles</strong></td></tr>
        <tr><td>Run:</td><td><strong>26.2 miles</strong></td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>After Nice in 2005 I competed at Ironman UK in Dorset in 2006 (recording my best ever time of 10:56 and coming 15th in my age group) and Lanzarote in 2007.</p>
      <p>4 months after the Lanzarote race my life was turned upside down by a truck.</p>
      <p>After recovering from the accident, getting back my triathlon mojo and getting my bikes converted for one-handed use I took on the inaugural Ironman Wales on 11th September 2011 - 4 years to the day since the accident. My time wasn't exactly electric but crossing that finish line was an emotional moment!</p>
      <p>I completed 4 other Ironman races over the next few years until Covid struck. I had an entry for the 10<sup>th</sup> edition of Ironman Wales in September this year but it didn't go ahead. My entry has rolled over to 2021 but, to be honest, I think I might have too much on my plate to train properly for it!</p>
      <h3>Other triathlon-related stuff</h3>
      <p>I'm also a Certified Ironman Coach, British Triathlon Level 1 Coach and during 2018 I set up Thrive Multisport, a triathlon coaching business. Covid has effectively wiped that out for now. I also founded South Cheshire Triathletes, a small club based in, funnily enough, South Cheshire. Covid hasn't quite killed that off ... yet!</p>

      <p>So that's me. I'm sorry my story is so long. I didn't have time to write a shorter one!</p>
