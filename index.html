    <p>Compared to everybody else in my cohort I'm an old bloke. At least, that's how it looks from an arithmetic perspective:</p>
    <p><code>my age > (2 x Holly's age)</code></p>
    <p>It's not all about arithmetic and elapsed time though is it? Age is mostly a mindset. I may be closing in fast on my 20,000<sup>th</sup> day but there's still life in this old <b>Git</b> yet.</p>
