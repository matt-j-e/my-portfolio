  <main>
    <p>Compared to everybody else in my cohort I'm an old bloke. At least, that's how it looks from an arithmetic perspective:</p>
    <p><code>my age > (2 x Holly's age)</code></p>
    <p>It's not all about arithmetic and elapsed time though is it? Age is mostly a mindset. I may be closing in fast on my 20,000<sup>th</sup> day but there's still life in this old <b>Git</b> yet.</p>

      <h2>What brought me here?</h2>
      <p>By day I am a Chartered Tax Adviser and have been for more years than I care to remember. During that time I have worked for the biggest firms (KPMG) to the smallest single-partner firms. Over the past few years I have become more and more disillusioned with the job. Maybe I have changed, maybe the job has changed; I don't know. But I no longer feel like my career has any worth. Perhaps helping already-wealthy people to pay less tax is not what the world needs right now.</p>
      <p>There was a short hiatus in my tax career. On September 11th 2007 a truck ran into the back of my car at 56mph when I was sat in a queue on the M6. <figure><img src="accident_image.jpg" alt="My car after the accident" width="400"><figcaption>My car after the accident</figcaption></figure> My girlfriend Kirstie (now my wife) and I nearly didn't make it. Kirstie broke her back (and several other things), I nearly lost my right arm. Surgeons managed to save it but nerve damage was such that my right hand doesn't work properly.</p>
      <p>I didn't work for a long time after the accident. During my recovery (physical and mental) I got interested in website development, taught myself a bit of HTML & CSS and dabbled in PHP. I actually contemplated not going back to my tax job and trying to make it as a web developer but, for reasons I won't bore you with, I never got anywhere with it and went back into tax. I still kept one eye on the tech world though.</p>
      <p>Another accident in 2016 (this time a bike crash in a middle distance triathlon that broke 5 bones, including pelvis) led to a bit more time off work. This time I discovered Python and taught myself the basics from books and online tutorials but, again, did nothing with it seriously.</p>
      <p>Than came 2020, Covid and lockdown v1.0. The triathlon world ground to a halt and I lost motivation to train so I had time on my hands. And when I have time on my hands ... yep, Python marched back in to fill the void. One thing led to another and I enrolled in Harvard University's online course called CS50 - An Introduction to Computer Science. I absolutely loved that so went on to do a follow-up called CS50W which focussed on web programming with Python & JavaScript.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, my mind went back 10+ years to my previous flirtation with web development and I started wondering if I could do anything with it seriously. On Twitter I bumped into Billy Morrison of this parish and discovered Manchester Codes and the rest, as they say, is history!</p>
      <p>So, to summarise, my decision to enrol with Manchester Codes was prompted by a near fatal car crash, a bike crash and a global pandemic!</p>
