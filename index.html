      <h2>Why Bootcamp at 54?</h2>
      <span class="top-link"><a href="#">top</a></span>
      <p>I first became interested in coding over 10 years ago while recovering from a car accident.</p>
      <figure><img id="accident" src="accident_image.jpg" alt="My car after the accident">
        <figcaption>What was left of my car</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>As you can imagine from that picture, it was a long recovery & I had time to teach myself the basics of HTML & CSS and dabble in PHP. I actually contemplated trying to make it as a web developer but I had lost the use of my right hand as a result of the accident and lacked the self confidence to make a go of it. I went back to my job as a tax consultant but still kept one eye on the tech world.</p>
      <p>Another accident in 2016 (this time a bike crash in a middle distance triathlon that broke 5 bones) led to a bit more time off work. This time I discovered Python and taught myself the basics from books and online tutorials but, again, did nothing with it seriously.</p>
      <p>Then came 2020, Covid and lockdown v1.0. My main interest outside work was triathlon and that scene ground to a halt, I lost motivation to train so I had time on my hands. And when I have time on my hands ... yep, Python marched back in to fill the void. One thing led to another and my mind went back 10+ years to my previous flirtation with web development. I started wondering if I could do anything with it seriously because I had been growing increasingly disillusioned with my current career.</p>
      <p>On Twitter I bumped into a Manchester Codes student, discovered their Software Engineer FastTrack Bootcamp and the rest, as they say, is history!</p>
      <p>So you could say my decision to attend Bootcamp was prompted by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a near-fatal car accident;</li>
        <li>a bike crash; and,</li>
        <li>a global pandemic.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Every cloud...</p>
      <p>Some might say that 54 is too old to contemplate such a drastic career shift. I disagree: <strong>you're never too old to learn new things, especially things you have developed a passion for.</strong></p>

        <h3>Hobbies & interests</h3>
        <p>Until the world shut down earlier this year (and I developed a coding obsession) I was a compulsive triathlete training around 10-12 hours a week focusing mainly on the ultra-distance races known as Ironman.</p>
        <p>To date, I have completed 8 Ironman races all around Europe: 3 BC (before crash) and 5 after. My best performance was Ironman UK in 2006 where I finished 15<sup>th</sup> in my age-group with a time of 10:56.</p>
        <p>I had an entry for the 10<sup>th</sup> edition of Ironman Wales in September this year but it didn't go ahead because of the Covid pandemic. My entry has rolled over to 2021 but, to be honest, I think I might have too much on my plate to train properly for it!</p>
        <aside>
          <h4>Other triathlon-related stuff</h4>
          <p>I'm a Certified Ironman Coach, British Triathlon Level 1 Coach and during 2018 I set up Thrive Multisport, a triathlon coaching business. Covid has effectively wiped that out for now.</p>
          <p>I also founded South Cheshire Triathletes, a small club based in, funnily enough, South Cheshire. Covid hasn't quite killed that off ... yet!</p>
