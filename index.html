      <p>I'm Matt, student in the November 2020 cohort of Manchester Codes' Software Engineer FastTrack course</p>
      <p>Compared to everybody else in my cohort I'm an old bloke. At least, that's how it looks from an arithmetic perspective:</p>
      <p><code>my age > (2 x Holly's age)</code></p>
      <p>It's not all about arithmetic and elapsed time though is it? Age is mostly a mindset. I may be closing in fast on my 20,000<sup>th</sup> day but there's still life in this old <s>dog</s> <b>Git</b> yet.</p>

      <h2>What brought me to Manchester Codes?</h2>
      <p>By day I am a Chartered Tax Adviser and have been for more years than I care to remember. The firms I have worked for range from the biggest (KPMG) to the smallest single-partner firms. Over the past few years I have become more and more disillusioned with the job. Maybe I have changed, maybe the job has changed; I don't know. But I no longer feel like my career has any worth. Perhaps helping already-wealthy people to pay less tax is not what the world needs right now.</p>
      <p>There was something of a hiatus in my tax career. On September 11<sup>th</sup> 2007 a truck ran into the back of my car at 56mph when I was sat in a queue on the M6. My girlfriend Kirstie (now my wife) was in the passenger seat and we nearly didn't make it, which is not surprising really considering the state of the car. Kirstie broke her back (and several other things), I nearly lost my right arm. Surgeons managed to save my arm but nerve damage was such that my right hand no longer functions.</p>
      <figure><img src="accident_image.jpg" alt="My car after the accident" width="200"><figcaption>My car after the accident</figcaption></figure>
      <p>I didn't work for a long time after the accident. During my recovery (physical and mental!) I got interested in web development, taught myself a bit of HTML & CSS and dabbled in PHP. I actually contemplated not going back to my tax job and trying to make it as a web developer but, for reasons I won't bore you with, I never got anywhere with it and went back into tax. I still kept one eye on the tech world though.</p>
      <p>Another accident in 2016 (this time a bike crash in a middle distance triathlon that broke 5 bones, including my pelvis) led to a bit more time off work. This time I discovered Python and taught myself the basics from books and online tutorials but, again, did nothing with it seriously.</p>
      <p>Then came 2020, Covid and lockdown v1.0. The triathlon world ground to a halt and I lost motivation to train so I had time on my hands. And when I have time on my hands ... yep, Python marched back in to fill the void. One thing led to another and I enrolled in Harvard University's online course called <em>CS50 - An Introduction to Computer Science</em>. I absolutely loved that so went on to do a follow-up called <em>CS50W</em> which focussed on web programming with Python & JavaScript.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, my mind went back 10+ years to my previous flirtation with web development and I started wondering if I could do anything with it seriously. On Twitter I bumped into Billy Morrison of this parish and discovered Manchester Codes and the rest, as they say, is history!</p>
      <p>So, to summarise, my decision to enrol with Manchester Codes was prompted by:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li>a near-fatal car accident;</li>
        <li>a bike crash; and,</li>
        <li>a global pandemic.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Every cloud...</p>

      <h2>My family</h2>

      <p>Luckily for me, Kirstie, who was in the car with me in the 2007 accident, agreed to marry me in 2011 and we had a son in 2012. He's called James and he's now an amazingly caring, generous, smart 8 year old with a wicked sense of humour. Kirstie is the love of my life, a <a href="http://www.kirstieedwards.co.uk">professional photographer</a> and senior manager with <a href="https://tropicskincare.com/">Tropic skincare</a>.</p>
      <p>I also have two grown-up daughters, Gemma & Sophie, from a previous relationship and two grandchildren, Benji and Zia. My son James was an uncle when he was born.</p>

      <h2>Hobbies & interests</h2>
      <p>Until the world shut down earlier this year (and I developed a coding obsession) I was a compulsive triathlete training around 10-12 hours a week on average (OCD? What do you mean?). I first discovered triathlon in 2000 and was immediately hooked. In 2005 I had a go at my first Ironman in Nice on the south coast of France. Again I was hooked.</p>
      <p>Ironman is an ultra-distance triathlon covering <strong>140.6 miles</strong> in total made up of:</p>
      <table cellpadding="7">
        <tr><td>Open water swim:</td><td><strong>2.4 miles</strong></td></tr>
        <tr><td>Bike:</td><td><strong>112 miles</strong></td></tr>
        <tr><td>Run:</td><td><strong>26.2 miles</strong></td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>After Nice in 2005 I competed at Ironman UK in Dorset in 2006 (recording my best ever time of 10:56 and coming 15th in my age group) and Lanzarote in 2007.</p>
      <p>4 months after the Lanzarote race my life was turned upside down by a truck.</p>
      <p>After recovering from the accident, getting back my triathlon mojo and getting my bikes converted for one-handed use I took on the inaugural Ironman Wales on 11th September 2011 - 4 years to the day since the accident. My time wasn't exactly electric but crossing that finish line was an emotional moment!</p>
      <p>I completed 4 other Ironman races over the next few years.</p>

          <tr><td>2019</td><td>Challenge Roth - Bavaria, Germany</td></tr>
        </table>
      </details>
      <p>I had an entry for the 10<sup>th</sup> edition of Ironman Wales in September this year but it didn't go ahead because of the Covid pandemic. My entry has rolled over to 2021 but, to be honest, I think I might have too much on my plate to train properly for it!</p>

        <h3>Other triathlon-related stuff</h3>
        <p>I'm also a Certified Ironman Coach, British Triathlon Level 1 Coach and during 2018 I set up Thrive Multisport, a triathlon coaching business. Covid has effectively wiped that out for now. I also founded South Cheshire Triathletes, a small club based in, funnily enough, South Cheshire. Covid hasn't quite killed that off ... yet!</p>

      <p>So that's me. I'm sorry my story is so long. I didn't have time to write a shorter one!</p>
